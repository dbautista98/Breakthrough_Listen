# bldw_tools

Link to the bldw [repo](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/obs_bin/blob/master/pipeline/bldw.py).

This directory contains some python scripts that I wrote to dig through `/home/obs/turboseti/` on the datacenter to find `.dat` files and group them according to which band they are from. 

Note that these files are not as generalized as my other programs, but they could serve as a good starting off point for someone just starting to use `bldw`. I found `bldw` to have a pretty steep learning curve.
